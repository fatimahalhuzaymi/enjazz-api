## Describtion:
The purpose of this project is to encourage students in the college to participate in various national and international activities and events.  You will organize the enrollment of college students in various activities including competitions, workshops, summer or short courses, volunteer work, leadership or participation in student committees, professional certification and being a member of national or international organizations.  A certain formula is called the “Achievement Formula” for calculating the points collected for each student by the type of activities performed and the student's GPA.  There will be a certain number of points to be achieved based on the type of activity completed, for example, 80 points will be allocated for participation in a competition, and an additional 50 points will be allocated for participation in the Student Committee.  .  The proposed website will provide a feature to announce the winning students who achieve the highest results from the formula at the end of the year.  The winning students will receive prizes and be given priority to join important excursions or activities.  The student can register directly in any activity if available through the proposed website.  A college administrative body will manage this website by adding, deleting or updating activity information.  Furthermore, the administrative elements will control all features in the proposed application including the completion formula, student accounts, lists of students accepted into activities, and collection of activity completion evidence from students.
